# Privacy Policy

Last updated: June 2, 2024

We may use your personal data to provide and improve Adapt. By using Adapt, you agree to the collection and use of
information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Interpretation

All terms in this Privacy Policy shall have the same meaning as in our [Terms of Service](/terms).

## Prelude

This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about how we collect, use, and disclose your personal data when you use
our service and the choices you have associated with that data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and
transparency in how we collect and use your data.

Unless otherwise mentioned in this Privacy Policy:

- Adapt will **never** disclose or sell your personal data to unauthorized third-parties without your consent.
- Adapt will **never** use your personal data for any purpose other than to provide and improve our service.
- Adapt is **open-source**, meaning that you can view the source code of our service to verify that we are not
  collecting or using your data in any way that is not disclosed in this Privacy Policy. You can find the source code
  for the various services provided by Adapt on our [GitHub repository](//github.com/adaptchat).

We also collect information provided by you; this information is referred to as *user-curated content*. For more
information on the limitations and agreements of user-curated content, please refer to our
[terms regarding user-curated content](/terms#user-curated-content).

### Use of Your Personal Data

Adapt may use Personal Data for the following purposes:

- __To provide and maintain our Service__, including to monitor the usage of our service.

- __To contact you:__ To contact You by email, telephone calls, SMS, or other equivalent forms of electronic communication, such as a mobile application's push notifications regarding updates or informative communications related to the functionalities, products or contracted services, including the security updates, when necessary or reasonable for their implementation.

  such information may be viewed by all users and may be publicly distributed outside.
- __With Your consent__: We may disclose your personal information for any other purpose only under your consent.

### Retention of Your Personal Data

We will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

We will retain and use your personal data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if
we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements
and policies.

We will also retain usage data for internal analysis purposes. Usage data is generally retained for a shorter period of
time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our service, or if we
are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

Adapt will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this
Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your personal data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are
adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.

### Removal of Your Personal Data

You have the right to delete or request that we assist in deleting the personal that we have collected about you at any
time for any reason.

Our service may give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the service directly.

You may update, amend, or delete your information at any time by signing in to your account (if you have one) and
visiting the account settings section that allows you to manage your personal information. You may also contact us to
request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that you have provided to us.

Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information when we have a legal obligation or lawful basis to
do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose your personal data if required to do so by law or
in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).

Adapt may also disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of Adapt
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with Adapt
- Protect the personal safety of users of the service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data

The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method
of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data,
we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### End-to-end Encryption

Adapt offers features that allow your data to be encrypted end-to-end. This means that your data is encrypted on your
device and only decrypted on the device of the intended recipient, unable to be intercepted and read by Adapt or any
other third party that may have access to the data in transit.

Generally, this privacy policy does not apply to any data that is encrypted end-to-end, as we do not have access to the
data in a readable form and thus cannot collect or use it. Adapt will only have access to quantitative data about usage,
such as:

- The number of messages sent
- When encryption is used (such as when encrypted messages were sent)
- The medium through which encryption is used (such as through a direct message or thread)

## Children's Privacy

Our service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information
from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with
personal data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13
without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our services.

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country and/or jurisdiction
requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent's consent before we collect and use that information.

## Links to Other Websites

Our service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you
will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

We will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on Adapt, prior to the change becoming effective and update
the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective
when they are posted on this page.
